# HANDOFF.md — CLIQUE Pix

**Last updated:** 2026-06-18
**Purpose:** Single entry-point for anyone taking over (or returning to) CLIQUE Pix. Read this top-to-bottom; it points into the deep docs for detail. If you read only one file, read this one.

> **What's authoritative:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` is the development guardrails (it wins on scope/architecture/patterns). This file is the *operational* handoff — how to build, deploy, where things live, current state, and the rules you must not break. Where they overlap, CLAUDE.md is the source of truth and this file links to it.

---

## 0. Where to start if you're new

1. **Read this file**, then `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (the guardrails) and `docs/PRD.md` (what the product is).
2. **Get access** to the accounts in §5 (Azure subscription, Entra, RevenueCat, Apple Developer, Google Play, GitHub repo). The `secrets/` folder is **gitignored** — get those files from Gene directly.
3. **Build the web client and run it** (§3) — it hits the production API, so you'll see real data with zero backend setup. Fastest way to get oriented.
4. **Build a debug Android APK** (§3) and sign in to see the mobile app.
5. Skim §6 (don't-regress invariants) before changing anything.

## 1. Project overview & current status

**CLIQUE Pix** is a **private, event-based photo and video sharing** mobile + web app. Users create **Cliques** (persistent groups), start **Events** (temporary media sessions, 24h/3d/7d), and share photos/videos that **auto-expire from the cloud** when the event ends. It is *not* a social network, feed, or messaging app.

**The two core loops** (every line of code serves one):
- **Photo:** sign in → create Event → capture/pick photo → edit (crop/draw/stickers/filters) → compress on-device → upload to Blob via SAS → feed + push → react/save/share → auto-delete.
- **Video:** capture/pick → client validate → resumable block upload → server transcode (FFmpeg → HLS + MP4 + poster) → uploader plays instantly from the local file while it transcodes → others play via HLS/MP4 → auto-delete.

**What's built (v1):** Entra CIAM auth (email+password, Google, Apple) with a 5-layer refresh-token defense; 13+ age gate; Cliques + invite (link/QR/SMS, deep-linked); Events; in-app camera + gallery for photo & video; client photo compression; video transcoding pipeline; event feed + reactions + save/share + uploader-or-organizer delete; event-scoped 1:1 DMs; avatars; **subscription paywall + 7-day free trial** (RevenueCat); FCM push; auto-expiry + orphan cleanup; **React web client** at clique-pix.com.

**Hard "do not build":** group chat, followers, public feeds/discovery, custom photo-editor (use `pro_image_editor`), video editing, 4K/HDR-preserved video, live streaming, AI features, Firebase backend (FCM transport only), Redis/SignalR/Service Bus.

**Architecture in one line:** `Flutter (iOS/Android) + React web → Azure Front Door → APIM → Azure Functions (TypeScript) → PostgreSQL + Blob Storage`, with the FFmpeg transcoder on **Container Apps Jobs**, **Entra External ID (CIAM)** for auth, and **Azure Web PubSub** for DM + `video_ready` real-time.

**Current launch status (2026-06-18):**
- **iOS:** 🍎 **in active Apple App Store review (2026-06-18)** — `1.0.0`, Apple ID `6766294274`, bundle `com.cliquepix.app`; currently still TestFlight (`https://testflight.apple.com/join/hWznNvJ6`) until the public listing is approved. iOS billing already wired (RevenueCat iOS key live; reviewer `vwhitley1967@gmail.com` has a verified lifetime promo grant). On approval: flip this line to public + switch the invite badge TestFlight → App Store.
- **Android:** ✅ **PUBLIC on Google Play production — vc9 passed Google review + released at 100% (2026-06-18)**, the first public release and first with working Android billing. Android billing fully unblocked end-to-end (subscriptions active, RTDN wired). Went straight to public on approval, so the License-testing purchase smoke test was **descoped** (billing validated by real public traffic + RC webhooks). Short tail owed: revert the temporary Admin grant on the RC service account to least-privilege, and Android tester promos. See `docs/GENE.md` / `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`.
- **Paywall:** live — single tier `plus`, **$3.99/mo or $39.99/yr**, 7-day no-card trial granted at first sign-in.
- **Web:** live at clique-pix.com.

## 2. Architecture map

| Surface | Stack | Lives in | Deep doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobile** | Flutter (Dart), Riverpod, Dio, `pro_image_editor`, `msal_auth`, `video_player`+`chewie`, `purchases_flutter` | `app/` | CLAUDE.md "Project Structure"; `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md` |
| **Web** | React 18 + Vite 5 + TS, Tailwind, Radix, React Query, `@azure/msal-browser`, `hls.js` | `webapp/` | `docs/WEB_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **Backend API** | Azure Functions (TypeScript, Node 20) | `backend/` | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **Transcoder** | FFmpeg in a SHA-pinned `jrottenberg/ffmpeg:6-alpine` container, on Container Apps Jobs | `backend/transcoder/` | `docs/VIDEO_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`, `docs/VIDEO_INFRASTRUCTURE_RUNBOOK.md` |

**Request path (control plane, no exceptions):** client → **Front Door** (`fd-cliquepix-prod`) → **APIM** (`apim-cliquepix-003`, Basic v2) → **Functions** (`func-cliquepix-fresh`) → **PostgreSQL** (`pg-cliquepixdb`) / **Blob** (`stcliquepixprod`). No direct Function URLs are published to clients.

**Async video path:** confirm endpoint enqueues on Storage Queue `video-transcode-queue` → **Container Apps Job** (`caj-cliquepix-transcoder`) pulls, transcodes, calls back to an internal Function endpoint (function-key auth) → Function updates DB + pushes `video_ready` via Web PubSub (`wps-cliquepix-prod`) + FCM.

**Data:** one Postgres DB; the `photos` table hosts **both** photos and videos (`media_type` column — historical name). One Blob container `photos` holds all media under `photos/{cliqueId}/{eventId}/{mediaId}/…`. Schema detail: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §Data Architecture.

**Auth:** Entra External ID **CIAM** tenant `cliquepix.ciamlogin.com`, client `7db01206-135b-4a34-a4d5-2622d1a888bf`, custom API scope `access_as_user`. The CIAM 12-hour refresh-token bug drives the **5-layer defense** (`docs/ENTRA_REFRESH_TOKEN_WORKAROUND.md`).

## 3. Build, run & test

**Toolchains:** Flutter **3.35.5** (pinned in CI), Node **20+** (local 22 is fine), Docker, Android SDK + a JDK (`keytool`/`apksigner` live in the SDK/JDK), Azure CLI (`az`) + Azure Functions Core Tools (`func`) for deploys.

### Mobile (Flutter) — `app/`

> **Project rule (non-negotiable):** ALWAYS `flutter clean` before an APK build, even for one-file changes — stale artifacts must not interfere.

```bash
cd app
flutter clean && flutter pub get

# Release APK (direct install / sideload):
flutter build apk --release --dart-define-from-file=dart_defines/release.json
#   → app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Release AAB (for Play upload):
flutter build appbundle --release

# Local debug run (debug keystore):
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=dart_defines/debug.json

# Tests / static analysis (what CI runs):
flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos
flutter test
```

**iOS build (`.ipa` for TestFlight / App Store) — macOS + Xcode ONLY:**
You **cannot** build an iOS `.ipa` on Windows or Linux — it requires the macOS-only iOS toolchain (Xcode, iOS SDK, CocoaPods, and code-signing against the Apple provisioning profiles). The Windows box is fine for everything else (Android AAB/APK, web, backend); for iOS, do this on the Mac:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull          # main carries the same code that ships Android/web
cd app
flutter clean && flutter pub get
cd ios && pod install && cd ..         # refresh CocoaPods (msal_auth, video_player, etc.)
flutter build ipa --release            # → build/ios/ipa/*.ipa
# upload via Xcode Organizer or Transporter (or xcrun altool/notarytool)
```

⚠️ **Build-number gotcha — Play and TestFlight track build numbers independently.** Flutter feeds the single pubspec `+N` to **both** Android `versionCode` and iOS `CFBundleVersion`, but the two stores don't share history. Before an iOS build, check **App Store Connect → TestFlight** for the highest build already uploaded under the current version (`1.0.0`): if a build with that `+N` already exists there, App Store Connect rejects the duplicate. Bump **only** the iOS build without disturbing the committed number:
```bash
flutter build ipa --release --build-number=<next>   # overrides CFBundleVersion for this build only
```
(`CFBundleDisplayName` = the brand name is baked into `app/ios/Runner/Info.plist` on `main` — no per-build step needed.)

**Signing & the MSAL redirect-URI nuance (important):**
- The MSAL Android redirect URI is chosen **at build time** by `MsalConstants.androidRedirectUri = String.fromEnvironment('MSAL_ANDROID_REDIRECT_URI', defaultValue: <release hash>)`. `dart_defines/release.json` = the **Play App Signing** hash (also the default); `dart_defines/debug.json` = the **debug keystore** hash. See `app/dart_defines/README.md`.
- Local release builds are signed with the **upload key** (`app/android/key.properties`). **Google re-signs with the Play App Signing key only when you distribute via Play.** So a locally-built release APK's cert (hash `YtL16/JyfHiAzjIBnw2zbiY9QzY=`) is *not* the Play hash — but that doesn't matter for sign-in (next bullet).
- **Sideloaded release APKs DO sign in** (verified 2026-06-06). CLIQUE Pix uses the CIAM **system-browser/Custom-Tabs** redirect flow (not the Authenticator broker), which does **not** validate the redirect-URI hash against the running app's signing cert. Only two things matter: the redirect hash is registered in Entra **and** declared as a `<data>` path in `AndroidManifest.xml` — both true for `4Fsai…`. Don't assume a cert mismatch blocks testing.
- The Android manifest registers **both** the release (`4Fsai…`) and debug (`W28+…`) redirect paths. Both hashes are also registered in the Entra app registration. If you regenerate a keystore, update: the matching `dart_defines/*.json`, the manifest `<data>` path, and the Entra redirect URI (see `app/dart_defines/README.md` + `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md` AUTH-1).

**iOS launch screen (branded splash) — native, no Flutter dependency:**
The launch screen is the static image iOS shows during cold-start before Flutter boots. It is a **native iOS storyboard + asset catalog** — there is **no `flutter_native_splash` dependency** and **no Dart code**; do not add one. Design = the primary brand gradient with the camera icon + white "CLIQUE Pix" wordmark (added 2026-06-18, PR #67 — replaced Flutter's default placeholder, which had been tripping the "default placeholder launch image" build warning). Three files own it:
- `app/ios/Runner/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard` — three layers: full-bleed gradient `imageView` (`scaleToFill`, pinned to all 4 view edges, **behind everything**), a centered icon `imageView` (120×120pt, `centerY` offset −30 so the icon+label group reads as centered), and a white `UILabel` "CLIQUE Pix" (system bold 30pt) pinned 24pt below the icon. The label is real text, not an image, so it stays crisp at any resolution.
- `app/ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/LaunchBackground.imageset/` — the gradient PNG (single universal image, 1290×2796). A **vertical** gradient stretched with `scaleToFill` covers every device aspect ratio without visible distortion because each row is a single solid color.
- `app/ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset/` — the camera icon at 1x/2x/3x (120/240/360px), derived from `app/assets/logo.png`.

Regenerate the assets (macOS, Pillow — `pip3 install pillow`):
```python
from PIL import Image
AQUA, BLUE, VIOLET = (0,0xC2,0xD1), (0x25,0x63,0xEB), (0x7C,0x3A,0xED)   # #00C2D1 → #2563EB → #7C3AED
def lerp(a,b,t): return tuple(round(a[i]+(b[i]-a[i])*t) for i in range(3))
W,H = 1290,2796; g = Image.new("RGB",(W,H)); px = g.load()
for y in range(H):
    t = y/(H-1); c = lerp(AQUA,BLUE,t/0.5) if t<0.5 else lerp(BLUE,VIOLET,(t-0.5)/0.5)
    for x in range(W): px[x,y] = c
g.save("app/ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/LaunchBackground.imageset/LaunchBackground.png")
ic = Image.open("app/assets/logo.png").convert("RGBA")            # 512×512 icon w/ alpha
d = "app/ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset"
for s,n in [("",120),("@2x",240),("@3x",360)]: ic.resize((n,n),Image.LANCZOS).save(f"{d}/LaunchImage{s}.png")
```
After changing the launch screen, `flutter clean` before rebuilding the IPA — Xcode caches the launch storyboard/asset catalog aggressively, and iOS itself caches it on-device (delete+reinstall to see changes on a device). To re-verify the layout *without* a full build, composite the gradient + 120pt icon (at `centerY` −30) + wordmark 24pt below in Pillow and eyeball contrast. The icon's own aqua square sits in the gradient's blue mid-zone but its light top + white camera body keep it legible — no white "platter" behind it is needed. If you change the gradient stops or icon, re-check that contrast. To change the wordmark, edit the `<label>` `text=` / `pointSize` in the storyboard (no asset regen needed).

### Web — `webapp/`

```bash
cd webapp
npm ci
npm run build         # tsc + vite → dist/  (this is the deploy gate)
npm run dev           # Vite on http://localhost:5173 — hits the PRODUCTION API, no local backend needed
npm run lint
```

### Backend — `backend/`

```bash
cd backend
npm ci
npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test   # exactly what Backend CI runs (221 tests)
npm run build                                  # tsc → dist/src/functions/*.js
func azure functionapp publish func-cliquepix-fresh   # deploy (manual)
# health: GET https://func-cliquepix-fresh.azurewebsites.net/api/health → 200
```

### Transcoder — `backend/transcoder/`

```bash
cd backend/transcoder
npm ci
npx tsc --noEmit && npx tsc
docker build -t cliquepix-transcoder:test .
```
Deploy is a retag + job update (see §4) — the running job is pinned to a semver tag, not `:latest`.

### CI (GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/`)

| Workflow | Runs | ⚠️ |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend CI** | `npm ci` → lint → `tsc --noEmit` → test | on `backend/**` |
| **Flutter CI** | `flutter pub get` → analyze → test → **debug APK (smoke)** | the APK build (added 2026-06-07) catches manifest/Gradle breakage `analyze`+`test` miss — see §6 |
| **Transcoder Build** | `npm ci` → tsc → `docker build` (+ ACR push on main) | on `backend/transcoder/**` |
| **Deploy Web App** | SWA action build + deploy | on `webapp/**` |
| **Clean up SWA PR environment** (`swa-cleanup.yml`) | deletes the PR preview env on PR close | every PR close |

All actions are pinned to `@v6` (Node 24). **Path-filter gotcha:** Backend/Flutter/Transcoder CI only run on a PR when their *source dirs* change — editing only their YAML doesn't trigger them on the PR (first validated on the post-merge `main` push).

## 4. Deploy channels & current live state

**Deploy is NOT uniform across surfaces — know which is which:**

| Surface | How it deploys | Live when |
|---|---|---|
| **Web / SWA** | **Auto** — GitHub Actions on merge to `main` touching `webapp/**` | minutes after merge |
| **Backend** | **Manual** — `func azure functionapp publish func-cliquepix-fresh` | when you run it |
| **Transcoder** | CI builds + pushes to ACR, **but the Container Apps Job is pinned to a SEMVER tag** (currently **`v0.1.8`**). `:latest` is NOT live until you `az acr import` retag → `az containerapp job update -n caj-cliquepix-transcoder -g rg-cliquepix-prod --image cracliquepix.azurecr.io/cliquepix-transcoder:vX.Y.Z` | after retag + job update |
| **Mobile** | **A new app build** (Play / TestFlight). Nothing auto-deploys. | when you ship a build |

**SWA staging-env auto-cleanup:** the SWA Free tier caps staging (preview) envs at **3 concurrent**; every PR creates one. Cleanup is handled by `.github/workflows/swa-cleanup.yml` (`pull_request: types: [closed]`, **no paths filter**). It's a *separate* workflow on purpose — `webapp-deploy.yml`'s trigger omits `types:` so it never receives `closed` (the old in-workflow close job ran 0 times across ~30 PRs and orphaned envs until the cap blocked deploys). Break-glass if it ever fails: `az staticwebapp environment delete --name swa-cliquepix-prod --resource-group rg-cliquepix-prod --environment-name <PR#> --yes`.

**Current live state (2026-06-11):**
- ✅ **Backend** lockout-incident fixes **deployed + verified 2026-06-11** (webhook `app_user_id` resolution order + RC REST client rewritten on API v2; `/api/health` 200 direct + Front Door; reviewer promo grant verified RC → webhook → `entitlement_active=t`). Prior `#22/#23` hardening also live.
- ⏰ **All non-entitled users are on a trial that ends 2026-07-11** (extended +30d via SQL during the 2026-06-11 lockout incident). Before that date: Play billing + `goog_` key, tester promo grants, or another extension. Reviewer is permanently covered (lifetime promo grant, verified).
- ✅ **Transcoder** running `v0.1.8` (TQ-1 poison-message guard). **Scale config changed 2026-06-11: `minExecutions` 1 → 0** (true scale-to-zero) after a cost incident — `minExecutions=1` was spawning an empty-poll execution every ~30s 24/7 (~$110-150/mo idle) and hosted a June 3-9 Azure metering anomaly (~$435, support-ticket candidate). Do not set it back to 1. See `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` cost-incident entry + `VIDEO_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` Decision 12 revision note.
- ✅ **Web** live with all recent fixes (DM ownership, EntitlementGuard error state, Lightbox MP4 download, web DM mark-read, **photo 3024/q88**, **avatar quality**).
- ⏳ **PENDING the next mobile build:** the 2026-06-11 Flutter fixes (never-blank paywall fallback, stable router, paywall allowlist, 402 handling — PR #55) + photo-quality 3024/q88 + avatar q90 + #24/#25. All on `main`; ships only in a new Play/TestFlight build. versionCode 7 (in Google review 2026-06-10) predates these.
- ✅ All 4 CI workflows green.

Deploy history + per-item status: `docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`.

## 5. Accounts, keys, domains & secrets index

> **No secret VALUES are in this repo or this doc — only locations/identifiers.** The `secrets/` folder (`.p8` keys, service-account JSON) is gitignored. Passwords live in Key Vault or with Gene. **A new owner must obtain from Gene directly:** the `secrets/` files, the Android keystore + `key.properties` passwords, the App Store reviewer account password, and any account logins.

### Domains & emails
| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Web app | `clique-pix.com` · API `api.clique-pix.com` (the only owned domain; **no email mailboxes** on it) |
| ⚠️ `cliquepix.com` (no hyphen) | **NOT owned** — never reference it |
| Public contact (footer, legal, "Contact Us") | `support@xtend-ai.com` (company: **Xtend-AI, LLC**) |
| App Store reviewer login | `vwhitley1967@gmail.com` — **email+password** (NOT Google/Apple SSO); password held by Gene, **not** in Key Vault. `users.id a16a8a7c-74ca-4efc-9460-27c08db4061e` (account **recreated 2026-06-11** — the original was an OTP-era Entra account that emailed codes instead of accepting a password; deleted in-app + in Entra and re-signed-up under the password flow; lifetime promo grant re-issued + verified) |
| App Store Connect contact / account owner | `genewhitley2017@gmail.com` |
| APIM publisher / Azure admin notifications | `gwhitley@xtend-ai.com` |
| Ops / Azure budget-alert recipient | `bluebuildapps@gmail.com` (old "BlueBuildApps" brand) |

### Azure — subscription "CLIQUE Pix" (`25410e67-b3c8-49a2-8cf0-ab9f77ce613f`), RG `rg-cliquepix-prod`
| Resource | Name |
|---|---|
| Function App | `func-cliquepix-fresh` |
| Storage (blob + queue) | `stcliquepixprod` |
| PostgreSQL Flexible Server | `pg-cliquepixdb` |
| Key Vault | `kv-cliquepix-prod` |

| Storage Queue | `video-transcode-queue` |
| Static Web App | `swa-cliquepix-prod` |
| App Insights | `appi-cliquepix-prod` |

**Key Vault contents (names only):** PostgreSQL connection string · FCM credentials · `revenuecat-webhook-secret` · `revenuecat-secret-api-key`. Function App reads them via Key Vault references (its managed identity has `Key Vault Secrets User`). Storage/Queue access is RBAC + managed identity (no account keys in code).

### Entra External ID (CIAM)
Tenant `cliquepix.ciamlogin.com` · app client `7db01206-135b-4a34-a4d5-2622d1a888bf` · custom API scope `access_as_user` · age gate via the `dateOfBirth` claim. **Android redirect hashes** registered (Entra + manifest): release/Play `4FsaiJ4wJWgM09R/hUh3osYJhgg=`, debug `W28+gAaZ9fNu1yL/GMRe94rK0dY=`. Web SPA redirects: `https://clique-pix.com/auth/callback`, `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`. Full setup: `docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`, `docs/AGE_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md`.

### RevenueCat (paywall)
Project `04f5314d` · entitlement `plus` · offering `default` (Monthly `$3.99` + Annual `$39.99`, 7-day trial) · webhook `whintgr721b9e5264` → `POST /api/internal/revenuecat-webhook` (Bearer secret in Key Vault) · iOS public SDK key `appl_OvhNypnojnQSEebpQtBikJYTHBa` (in `app/lib/core/constants/revenuecat_constants.dart`); **Android `goog_` key still pending Play setup.** Reviewer + beta access = RevenueCat **Promotional** grants (see §6). Punch list: `docs/GENE.md`.

### Apple / Google
Apple App ID `6766294274` · bundle `com.cliquepix.app` · Team `4ML27KY869` · Sign-in-with-Apple Services ID `com.cliquepix.app.service`, Key `4NYXZNV9VD`. ASC API key `AuthKey_TP9C6PA769.p8` + IAP key `SubscriptionKey_7K28U2Z2B2.p8` in `secrets/`. Android package `com.cliquepix.clique_pix`; Play service-account JSON (when set up) in `secrets/`.

### Android signing
`app/android/key.properties` → the **upload key** (cert hash → `YtL16/JyfHiAzjIBnw2zbiY9QzY=`). Play App Signing re-signs to `4Fsai…`. The debug keystore (`~/.android/debug.keystore`) on Gene's machine matches the registered debug hash `W28+…`.

### GitHub Actions secrets (repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)
The CI/deploy workflows read these repo secrets:
| Secret | Used by | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` | `webapp-deploy.yml`, `swa-cleanup.yml` | yes — web deploy + preview-env cleanup |
| `ACR_USERNAME` / `ACR_PASSWORD` | `transcoder-build.yml` (ACR push on `main`) | yes — transcoder image push |
| `ANDROID_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` | `flutter-ci.yml` (the debug-APK smoke build) | **optional** — if set, CI builds against the real `google-services.json`; if unset, CI writes a harmless placeholder (the smoke APK is discarded, so dummy Firebase values are fine). Set it only if you want CI to exercise the real Firebase config. |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | all workflows | auto-provided by GitHub |

## 6. Known issues, gotchas & DON'T-REGRESS invariants

These are load-bearing rules — each was added after an incident, an audit finding, or a confirmed upstream bug. Treat every one as a guardrail. Detail lives in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` ("Hard rule" callouts), `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_2026-06-04.md` (the don't-regress list), and `docs/ENTRA_REFRESH_TOKEN_WORKAROUND.md`.

### Auth — Entra CIAM 12h refresh-token bug + 5-layer defense
- **The 12h inactivity refresh-token expiry (`AADSTS700082`) is a real, portal-unfixable CIAM bug.** The whole 5-layer defense exists to keep users signed in past it — don't simplify it away.
- **The session-expired regex must stay synced across exactly 3 sites** (`AuthInterceptor._isSessionExpired`, `AuthRepository._extractAadstsCode`, `AuthNotifier._handleSilentSignInFailure`; codes `AADSTS700082`/`AADSTS500210`/`no_account_found`). One disagreement strands the user instead of routing to Welcome-Back re-login.
- **`pendingRefreshFlagKey` is cleared BEFORE awaiting the refresh** — else a hung refresh poisons every future resume.
- **Do NOT add `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` to iOS `Info.plist`** — Layer 4 is Android-only; a declaration with no handler crashes with SIGABRT ("app vanishes after sign-in").
- **iOS MSAL broker MUST be `Broker.msAuthenticator`, not `Broker.safariBrowser`**, at all 3 PCA sites — `safariBrowser`'s persistent cookie jar traps account-switchers on "Continue as <previous user>".

### APIM — rate limiting REMOVED at all 4 scopes; never re-add
- **No `<rate-limit>` / `<rate-limit-by-key>` / `<quota>` at ANY scope** (Global/Product/API/Operation) until APIM leaves Developer/Basic tier — five 429 incidents. Abuse protection is application-layer (JWT, membership checks, SAS expiry, orphan cleanup) + client `silentRetryOn429`. When diagnosing a 429, audit **all four scopes AND `bicep/apim/main.bicep`**.

### Media deletion — always via `deleteMediaAssets`
- **All media deletes go through `deleteMediaAssets(media)`** (`backend/src/shared/services/blobService.ts`), which prefix-deletes a video's whole dir (HLS/fallback/poster) vs a photo's original+thumb. Deleting only `blob_path`+`thumbnail_blob_path` orphans video blobs forever (hit `deleteEvent`/`deleteMe`/expiry/`leaveClique` before the fix). Sole-owner `leaveClique` deletes blobs **before** `DELETE FROM cliques` (CASCADE removes the rows otherwise).

### Clique ownership — keep `created_by` and `role='owner'` in lockstep
- **A clique with ≥1 member must have exactly one `role='owner'` member, and `cliques.created_by_user_id` must point at that member.** `created_by_user_id` is nullable (FK `ON DELETE SET NULL` when a creator deletes their account) and the **client reads it for `isOwner`**, so EVERY ownership change updates BOTH `role` AND `created_by` (`cliqueOwnershipService.promoteToOwner`; `transferOwnership`'s single-statement `CASE` swap). `deleteMe` + `leaveClique` auto-promote the longest-tenured member (`joined_at ASC, user_id ASC`); migration `014` backfilled existing orphans. Don't switch the client to a role-only `is_owner` model without a forced-update floor — already-installed builds read `created_by`. (Added 2026-06-16; the grey-screen crash, PR #59, was the first symptom.)

### Invite codes — 128-bit entropy is the only brute-force defense
- **`generateInviteCode` stays `crypto.randomBytes(16)` (128-bit); the join validator `INVITE_CODE_MAX_LENGTH` (64) stays ≥ the code length.** Join resolves a clique by `invite_code` alone with no rate limiting; a too-small cap silently truncated codes and made every new clique un-joinable (the INV-1 regression).

### Uploads — atomic claim between confirm and orphan-cleanup
- **Upload-confirm UPDATEs are guarded on `status='pending'`; the orphan timer deletes the blob only after its guarded row-delete wins.** Never revert to read-then-update / unconditional delete — they race and the timer can delete an in-flight confirm's blob.

### Paywall — a v1 requirement, not optional
- **Do NOT regress to a free tier / remove the paywall** without product approval. Backend authoritative: `requireActiveEntitlement` 402s `SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED`; effective access = `entitlement_active OR trial_ends_at > NOW()`.
- **Reviewer + beta access = RevenueCat Promotional grants, never a DB override of `entitlement_active`.** (Extending `users.trial_ends_at` via SQL is the sanctioned emergency unblock — it IS the trial mechanism; used 2026-06-11.)
- **`forceSyncFromRcApi` must keep no-end-date lifetime/promo grants active and never down-grade via a synthetic event** (synthetic = RENEWAL-only). A `plus` with no end date (`expiresAtMs === null`) IS the reviewer/beta mechanism; treating it as inactive hard-paywalled reviewers on "Refresh Subscription" (the PAY fix).
- **`PaywallView` is ONLY mounted behind the `paywallOfferingProvider` pre-flight** — it's a bare platform view with no load-failure callback; unconfigured SDK (placeholder key) or unloadable offerings = BLANK SCREEN (the 2026-06-11 lockout). Failures must render the branded `_PaywallFallback`.
- **RC webhook resolves the user as the FIRST valid UUID among `app_user_id` → `original_app_user_id` → `aliases[]`** — RC pins `original_app_user_id` to `$RCAnonymousID:…` forever for SDK-created customers; preferring it dropped every webhook for anonymous-origin customers (incl. promo grants).
- **`revenuecatRestClient.ts` stays on RC API v2** — the Key Vault secret is a v2-only key; v1 endpoints reject it (error 7723) and the failures are invisible (best-effort paths).

### Router — stable instance, refreshListenable for redirects
- **`routerProvider` must NOT `ref.watch` auth/access state** — GoRouter recreation resets navigation to `initialLocation` (proven in `app/test/router_recreation_behavior_test.dart`). Router is created once per signed-in identity (watches `currentUserIdProvider` only — keeps the cross-user tab-stack reset); redirect re-eval via `refreshListenable` + `ref.read`. Paywall-exempt prefixes include `/invite/` + `/diagnostics`. `DeepLinkService` takes a router *getter*, never a captured instance.

### FCM — de-register on sign-out + permanent-vs-transient purge
- **Sign-out/delete de-register the FCM token before clearing the JWT** (`DELETE /api/push-tokens`).
- **Only permanent FCM errors (404 `UNREGISTERED` / 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) purge a token** (`isPermanentTokenError`) — a transient blip must not purge valid tokens (it was disabling the Layer-2 silent-push defense fleet-wide).

### Client models — tolerate null creator/uploader FKs; never read `AsyncValue.value` in build
- **Deleting a user account nulls `created_by_user_id` / `uploaded_by_user_id`** on that user's cliques/events/photos/videos (FK `ON DELETE SET NULL`) — a legit, reachable state. The Flutter models MUST parse these as `as String? ?? ''` (NOT `as String`), or a single orphaned-creator row throws `Null is not a subtype of String` and errors the whole list provider. `''` is safe — these ids are only used in `== currentUserId` ownership checks. Guarded by `app/test/model_null_creator_test.dart`. (Z Fold 7 grey-screen crash, 2026-06-16.)
- **Never read `AsyncValue.value` inside `build()` — use `.valueOrNull`.** `.value` **rethrows** when the provider is in an error state, so `value ?? []` throws during build and greys out the whole screen. This is what turned one bad clique into a full Home crash.
- **`main.dart` has a global error boundary** (`FlutterError.onError` + `platformDispatcher.onError` + `ErrorWidget.builder`) so a build-time throw self-reports on a dark diagnostic screen instead of Flutter's silent grey `RenderErrorBox`. `_kVerboseErrorScreen` shows the stack (beta); flip to `false` once client crash telemetry (`/api/telemetry/error`) lands. Don't remove the boundary.

### Photo quality — editor cap must stay ≥ the compression cap
- **In `camera_capture_screen.dart`, `pro_image_editor`'s `imageGenerationConfigs.maxOutputSize` (`Size(4032,4032)`) must stay ≥ `AppConstants.maxImageDimension` (3024).** The editor's default is `Size(2000,2000)`, which silently re-caps every photo below 3024 before the authoritative compress step — degrading quality with no error. Photos are **3024 px / JPEG q88** (mobile + web in lockstep), avatars **q90** (mobile).

### Play Store policy — media permissions are forbidden
- **Never declare `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` in the Android manifest.** Google Play rejected versionCode 6 (2026-06-10, Photo and Video Permissions policy) — those permissions are reserved for apps whose *core purpose* is broad gallery access. CLIQUE Pix never needs them: `image_picker` uses the permission-free Android Photo Picker and `gal` saves via MediaStore. The manifest pins both with `tools:node="remove"` so no plugin update can re-introduce them in the manifest merge. If a future feature seems to need them, it almost certainly should use the Photo Picker instead.

### Build / CI — two recurring footguns
- **Never put a literal `--` inside an XML comment (`<!-- … -->`)** — XML forbids it, and the parser rejects the whole file. **This has bitten twice:** `apim_policy.xml` (a `--protocols` comment broke the APIM Basic v2 deploy, 2026-05-05) and **`AndroidManifest.xml`** (`--dart-define-from-file` in a comment broke **all** release APK/AAB builds, fixed PR #41, 2026-06-06). Watch any hand-edited XML.
- **Flutter CI now builds a debug APK** (added 2026-06-07) so manifest/XML/Gradle/plugin breakage that only fails at `flutter build apk` is caught — `analyze`+`test` alone missed the #41 manifest bug. It's a **debug** build (no signing-keystore secret needed; the manifest merger + native compile still run), so R8/minify-only *release* issues remain uncovered. And `flutter clean` before every release build (project rule).

## 7. Recent work log

### 2026-06-18 — first App Store production build + branded iOS launch screen
- **`1.0.0 (9)` IPA built on the Mac and uploaded to App Store Connect via Transporter — first production submission, now in Apple review.** (Build number `+9` matches Android Play vc9; iOS/TestFlight build numbers are tracked independently from Play, so verify the highest `+N` already in TestFlight under `1.0.0` before each iOS build to avoid a duplicate-rejection — bump just iOS with `flutter build ipa --release --build-number=<next>`.)
- **Branded iOS launch screen** (PR #67) replaced Flutter's default placeholder — primary brand gradient + camera icon + white "CLIQUE Pix" wordmark. Cleared the "default placeholder launch image" build warning. Native storyboard + asset catalog only, no `flutter_native_splash`. Full build/regen recipe in §3 → "iOS launch screen (branded splash)".

### 2026-06-11 — lockout incident (blank screen after login) — resolved same-day

All 14 users locked out: the migration-013 trial backfill expired 2026-06-09 (Phase 6 grants unissued) and Android's paywall rendered BLANK (placeholder `goog_` key + `PaywallView` has no load-failure callback). Resolution, in order:
- **Trials extended +30d via SQL** (effective immediately, no build) → all users in until **2026-07-11**.
- **Reviewer lifetime promo grant** issued + verified end-to-end into Postgres.
- **Two production backend bugs found + fixed + deployed** during grant verification: webhook `app_user_id` resolution order (dropped all anonymous-origin-customer webhooks) and the RC REST client calling API v1 with the v2-only key (forceSync + GDPR delete broken since launch).
- **Flutter hardening on `main` (PR #55, next build):** never-blank paywall pre-flight + branded fallback, stable-router refactor (auth churn was resetting navigation to Home — empirically proven), `/invite/`+`/diagnostics` paywall exemptions (audit L5/L6), 402 handling.

Full record: `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` top entry; playbooks added to `BETA_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md`.

### 2026-06-04 → 2026-06-07 session

This session opened by pulling the security-audit branch from a Mac workstation (PR #17) and ran a full pre-submission hardening + cleanup pass. PRs **#17–#41**, all merged to `main`.

**Security audit + backend hardening**
- **#17** security & detrimental-bug audit (128-bit invite codes, canonical `deleteMediaAssets`, atomic upload-confirm claim, FCM de-register, CVE patches).
- **#18** added the Play App Signing SHA-256 to `assetlinks.json` (Android App Links auto-verify on Play-signed builds).
- **#19** ship-blockers: **INV-1** (invite-join regression — codes truncated, every clique un-joinable), **BLOB-1** (sole-owner clique-delete blob orphan), **TQ-1** (transcoder poison-message guard `MAX_DEQUEUE_COUNT=5`), **AUTH-1** (MSAL Android release redirect hash).
- **#21** reviewer-lockout: keep null-expiry promotional/lifetime grants active in `forceSyncFromRcApi`.
- **#22** PAY hardening: RevenueCat webhook always-200-on-non-auth (retry-storm guard) + non-UUID guard + `markExpired` TOCTOU.
- **#23** **NOTIF-1** (web-only members get in-app notification rows), **NOTIF-2** (permanent-vs-transient FCM token purge), **TQ-2** (event-expiry vs in-flight-transcode race).
- **Backend #22/#23 were deployed via `func publish` and verified** (webhook 200 on valid signature, 401 on invalid; `/api/health` 200).

**Flutter & web fixes**
- **#24** Flutter polish — `briefError` launch-crash, friendly bootstrap errors, gallery-save temp-file leaks.
- **#25** 5-layer auth state-machine hardening — session-resurrection epoch guard, 401 retry-loop guard, single-flight refresh mutex, optimistic-entitlement reset on identity change.
- **#26** webapp — DM sender-identity (UUID vs Entra OID), recoverable EntitlementGuard error state, Lightbox MP4 download.
- **#27** webapp — web DM mark-read sends `last_read_message_id` (was 400ing).

**CI & ops**
- **#28** bumped `actions/checkout` + `setup-node` to `@v6` (Node 24) across all 4 workflows.
- **#29** **SWA staging-env auto-cleanup** — new `swa-cleanup.yml` (root cause of the orphan-env failures: `webapp-deploy.yml`'s `pull_request` trigger omitted `types:`, so `closed` was never delivered). Proven working.
- **#41** fixed a malformed `AndroidManifest.xml` (illegal `--` in a comment, latent since #19) that **blocked all release APK/AAB builds**.

**Docs sync** — **#20/#30/#31/#32/#33** brought all ~20 `/docs` files current vs PR #17–28 (each gap grounded against the actual code), recorded deploys, and updated `GENE.md`.

**Email/domain cleanup** — **#34/#35/#36/#37** removed the never-existed `appreview@cliquepix.com` (reviewer is `vwhitley1967@gmail.com`) and `hello@clique-pix.com` (footer now `support@xtend-ai.com`), scrubbed the dead `cliquepix.app` domain, and corrected the reviewer-credentials block + legacy URLs.

**Photo / avatar quality** — **#38** raised photos from 2048 px/q80 to **3024 px/q88** (~3 MP → ~6.9 MP for a 12 MP phone) across mobile + web, including the `pro_image_editor` `maxOutputSize` lockstep; **#40** raised mobile avatars to **q90**; **#39** fixed the stale cross-references.

**Verification** — a clean release APK was built and **sideloaded successfully** on a Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 (confirming sideloaded release APKs sign in fine, despite the upload-key cert).

**What's pending**
- **Ship a new mobile build** (Play/TestFlight) to deliver the 3024/q88 photo + q90 avatar quality to mobile users (it's live on web).
- ✅ **Done (2026-06-07):** added a `flutter build apk --debug` smoke step to Flutter CI — catches the #41 manifest class going forward.
- Finish the Play subscription setup (RevenueCat Android `goog_` SDK key + RTDN) and the App Store / Play review submissions.
