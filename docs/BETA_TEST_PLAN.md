# Clique Pix — Open Beta Smoke Test Plan

**Last Updated:** May 4, 2026

This is a manual smoke test checklist to run before each beta release. Every item must pass on **both iOS and Android** unless noted otherwise.

---

## Prerequisites

- Two physical devices (or one device + one emulator) with separate accounts
- Device A = "Uploader" (primary tester)
- Device B = "Member" (secondary tester)
- Good WiFi connection for initial testing; repeat video upload on LTE to verify resumability
- Fresh app install (clear data or reinstall)

---

## 1. Authentication

- [ ] **Sign in** — email OTP flow completes, lands on home screen
- [ ] **iOS post-auth no-crash regression (added 2026-05-01)** — on iOS only: from Profile → Sign Out → force-close the app from the app switcher → relaunch from the home screen → tap Get Started → complete MSAL/Safari auth. App MUST stay foregrounded after Safari dismisses and land on Events. **Failure mode to watch for:** app vanishes back to the iOS home screen the instant Safari closes. Caused historically by `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` in `app/ios/Runner/Info.plist` declared without a registered launch handler (SIGABRT on the FlutterViewController re-attach). See `BETA_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` "iOS user reports 'app vanishes the second I sign in'" for diagnostic and `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` "BGTask SIGABRT iOS post-auth crash" for the fix history.
- [ ] **Cold start — returning user, no splash** — after a successful sign-in, kill the app and reopen. The first frame drawn must be the Events screen. There should be no splash screen, no "Get Started" button flash, and no button-spinner. `cold_start_optimistic_auth` + `background_verification_success` events appear in Token Diagnostics.
- [ ] **Cold start — first-time user, enabled button** — uninstall and reinstall. Open the app. The first frame drawn must be LoginScreen with the "Get Started" button fully enabled and labeled (no spinner). `cold_start_unauthenticated` event appears.
- [ ] **Cold start — expired session routes to Welcome Back** — sign in, then force-expire the session (Token Diagnostics → rewrite `lastRefreshTime` to 13h ago and reset MSAL cache manually if available, or just wait 13+ hours). Kill and reopen the app. Within ~2 seconds the Events shell should appear briefly and then be replaced by the Welcome Back dialog. `background_verification_timeout` or `cold_start_relogin_required` event appears.
- [ ] **Escape hatch on stuck sign-in** — on LoginScreen, tap "Get Started" and (for test purposes) leave the browser open without completing. At 15 seconds, a "Having trouble? Sign in with a different account" link appears below the button. Tapping it resets MSAL cache and restarts interactive sign-in. `login_screen_escape_hatch_shown` + `login_screen_escape_hatch_tapped` events appear.
- [ ] **Token persists** — kill app, reopen, still signed in
- [ ] **Token refresh (Layer 3 — foreground resume)** — leave app closed for 6+ hours, reopen. Still signed in. Unlock Token Diagnostics (Profile → tap version 7×) and confirm an entry: `foreground_refresh_success` with timestamp matching the reopen.
- [ ] **Sign out** — tap sign out, returns to login screen, reopening app shows login
- [ ] **Re-login after 12h (Layer 5 — Welcome Back)** — wait 13h without opening the app → reopen → "Welcome back, [Name]" dialog appears with email pre-filled. Tap Sign In → one-tap re-auth succeeds, no email re-entry.
- [ ] **Stale-token cold-start does NOT leak raw DioException (added 2026-05-03)** — return after 12+ hours OR force-expire the session per the row above. Cold-launch the app. The Events shell may render the friendly error widget ("Couldn't load events. Pull to refresh.") for a frame, but **MUST NOT** show the raw `"DioException [bad response]: This exception was thrown..."` text anywhere. Within ~1-2 frames the WelcomeBackDialog appears (interceptor-triggered fast path). App Insights shows `welcome_back_shown { source: 'interceptor', reason: 'AADSTS700082' }`. **Failure mode to watch for:** any verbatim "DioException" text on screen. If present, regression in `home_screen.dart` (someone reverted to `error.toString()`) — re-apply `friendlyApiErrorMessage` import and call
- [ ] **Battery-exempt prompt (Layer 1, Android)** — on first launch after login on Android, the "Stay Signed In" dialog appears. Grant it. Token Diagnostics → `battery_exempt_granted` event appears.
- [ ] **Silent push refresh (Layer 2) — Android happy path** — in Token Diagnostics, note current `lastRefreshTime`. Background the app for at least the timer cycle (~20 min), or use the backend `refreshTokenPushTimer` to target the user manually by backdating `last_activity_at` to 10h ago. Return to Token Diagnostics → `silent_push_received` + `silent_push_refresh_success` events. `lastRefreshTime` advanced without any UI interaction.
- [ ] **Silent push refresh (Layer 2) — iOS fallback flag** — same setup on iOS. Acceptable outcomes: either `silent_push_refresh_success` directly, OR `silent_push_fallback_flag_set` followed by `foreground_refresh_success` on next foreground. Both paths keep the user signed in.
- [ ] **Silent push does not wake — force-kill case (iOS)** — force-kill app, wait 13h, reopen → `cold_start_relogin_required` + Welcome Back dialog. Expected (iOS policy).
- [ ] **Token Diagnostics unlock** — Profile → tap version 7× → "Token Diagnostics unlocked" snackbar; new "Token Diagnostics" text link appears below the version.
> **Age gate enforced server-side** in `authVerify` via the `dateOfBirth` token claim. Entra collects DOB once at signup; backend reads the claim on first login; under-13 returns HTTP 403 and the Entra account is best-effort deleted via Microsoft Graph. See `docs/AGE_VERIFICATION_RUNBOOK.md`.

- [ ] **Age gate — new sign-up over 13** — tap Get Started → Entra sign-up form asks for DOB once → **DOB ≥ 13** (e.g. 1990-05-15) → signup completes → app lands on home screen. App Insights: `age_gate_passed` event with coarse `ageBucket` (never raw DOB). SQL: `SELECT age_verified_at FROM users WHERE email_or_phone = '<test>'` returns a recent timestamp.
- [ ] **Age gate — new sign-up under 13** — tap Get Started → Entra sign-up form → **DOB < 13** (e.g. 2020-01-01) → Entra signup completes, but the app returns to the login screen with a red error banner reading *"You must be at least 13 years old to use Clique Pix."* (surfaced from backend `AGE_VERIFICATION_FAILED` response, mapped in `auth_providers.dart:AuthNotifier.signIn`). Tapping **Dismiss** clears the banner. App Insights: `age_gate_denied_under_13`. Within ~60s verify the Entra account is deleted: `az rest --method GET --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?\$filter=mail eq '<test-email>'"` returns empty `value: []`.
- [ ] **Age gate — returning user — no re-prompt** — sign out of a valid over-13 account, tap Get Started → Entra sign-in only (no DOB field) → lands on home screen. `age_verified_at` unchanged (COALESCE preserves it).
- [ ] **Age gate — different account on same device** — sign out, register a NEW account with a different email → Entra sign-up form asks for DOB (new account). Independent of prior account's verification.
- [ ] **Age gate — JWT claim check** — decode a post-login access token at `https://jwt.ms`. Verify `extension_<GUID>_dateOfBirth` is present in claims.
- [ ] **Age gate — endpoint check** — unauth `curl -X POST https://func-cliquepix-fresh.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/verify` returns 401 with `UNAUTHORIZED`. `validate-age` endpoint returns 404 (deleted — expected).
- [ ] **App shell — branded header on all 4 tabs** — after sign-in, tap through Home → Cliques → Notifications → Profile. Every tab shows the same branded hero: rounded app-icon logo (with a soft aqua glow) next to the "Clique Pix" wordmark in the aqua → blue → violet gradient, with the per-screen title ("Home" / "My Cliques" / "Notifications" / "Profile") in its own gradient below it. Each tab has a distinct background wash (aqua on Home, deep blue on Cliques, violet on Notifications, pink on Profile). Scroll the Home feed up — the branded hero collapses away, leaving a thin dark toolbar (with any per-screen actions like Refresh on Cliques / Clear All on Notifications). Scroll back to top — header reappears.

## 2. Cliques

- [ ] **Create clique** — enter name, clique appears in list
- [ ] **Generate invite link** — share sheet opens with invite URL
- [ ] **Join via invite link** — Device B taps link, app opens to join screen, joins successfully
- [ ] **View members** — both devices see each other in member list
- [ ] **Leave clique** — Device B leaves, member list updates on Device A
- [ ] **QR code** — QR generated on Device A, scannable by Device B

## 3. Events

- [ ] **Create event** — pick clique, enter name, select duration (24h / 3 days / 7 days), event appears in list
- [ ] **Event visible to member** — Device B sees the event in their list
- [ ] **Event card shows photo count** — event card displays correct photo count with proper singular/plural ("1 photo" / "3 photos")
- [ ] **Event card shows video count** — after uploading a video, event card shows video count with videocam icon (e.g., "1 photo 🎥 1 video")
- [ ] **Delete event** — organizer deletes, event disappears from both devices
- [ ] **Delete push notification** — Device B receives "Event Deleted" push when Device A deletes
- [ ] **Event Detail bottom nav** — open an event → 4-tab bottom nav (Home, Cliques, Notifications, Profile) is visible with Home highlighted. Tap each tab in turn: each transitions directly to the corresponding tab's root screen. Reopen the event and confirm the AppBar back arrow still returns to the previous screen (Home dashboard, events list, or notifications).
- [ ] **Full-screen children stay immersive** — from Event Detail: tap Photo (camera), Video → upload → player, and Messages → DM chat. Confirm NONE of these screens show the bottom nav.
- [ ] **Home Create Event buttons — single entry point per state** — open Home tab: no bottom-right `+ Create Event` FAB visible in any state. Confirm each state has exactly ONE Create Event CTA: brand-new account shows "Create Your First Event"; account with cliques but no active events shows "Create Event"; account with ≥1 active event shows "Start Another Event" below the active event cards; account with only expired events shows "Start a New Event". Tapping any of them opens `/events/create`.

## 4. Photos

- [ ] **Capture photo** — in-app camera captures, editor opens
- [ ] **Edit photo** — crop, draw, add sticker, apply filter, save
- [ ] **Upload from camera roll** — pick existing photo, editor opens, upload succeeds
- [ ] **Photo appears in feed** — photo visible within 5 seconds on Device A
- [ ] **Push notification** — Device B receives "New Photo!" push
- [ ] **Photo visible to member** — Device B sees photo in event feed
- [ ] **Thumbnail loads** — feed shows thumbnail, not full-size
- [ ] **Full-size on tap** — tapping photo loads full resolution
- [ ] **Save to device** — long press or menu → "Save to Device" → photo in gallery
- [ ] **Batch download (photos)** — select multiple photos → download all → verify in gallery
- [ ] **Batch download (mixed)** — select photos + videos → download all → verify both types in gallery
- [ ] **Batch download label** — photos only → "Download N Photos"; videos only → "Download N Videos"; mixed → "Download N Items"
- [ ] **Share externally** — share sheet opens, can send via Messages/WhatsApp/etc.
- [ ] **React** — tap heart/laugh/fire/wow, reaction appears, other device sees it
- [ ] **Reactor strip hidden when total = 0** — fresh photo with no reactions: above the reaction pill row, NOTHING is rendered (no empty avatar stack, no "0 reactions" text)
- [ ] **Reactor strip appears on first reaction** — Device B reacts ❤️ on Device A's photo. Within 30 sec (next feed poll), Device A's card shows `[B's avatar] 1 reaction` immediately above the pill row
- [ ] **Strip text agrees with pill totals** — Device B reacts ❤️ AND 🔥 on the same photo. Strip text reads `2 reactions`. Pills show `❤️ 1 🔥 1` (sum = 2). Total is total reactions, not distinct people — matches Facebook
- [ ] **Tap strip opens "All" tab** — tap the strip → bottom sheet slides up, "All N" tab pre-selected, list shows every reactor with avatar + name + reaction emoji on the right
- [ ] **Per-type tabs only show non-empty types** — sheet has tabs `All / ❤️ / 🔥` when only heart and fire have reactions. NO `😂` or `😮` tabs visible
- [ ] **Tab order is fixed (heart / laugh / fire / wow)** — even when fire was added first, the ❤️ tab appears before the 🔥 tab (matches `AppConstants.reactionTypes`)
- [ ] **Long-press a pill with count > 0 opens filtered sheet** — long-press the 🔥 pill on any photo with at least one fire reaction → sheet opens already on the 🔥 tab
- [ ] **Long-press a pill with count = 0 = no-op** — long-press the 😮 pill on a photo with zero wow reactions → nothing happens (no haptic, no sheet)
- [ ] **Same user with two reactions = two rows on All tab** — Device A reacts ❤️ AND 🔥 on their own photo. Open the sheet → All tab shows TWO rows for Device A (one with ❤️, one with 🔥), newest first
- [ ] **Sheet refetches on reopen** — open sheet, close, react via the pill, reopen → sheet shows updated counts (no stale data)
- [ ] **Empty state copy** — manually create a photo, react then unreact (so reaction_counts is empty) — the strip disappears entirely; there is no "no reactions yet" empty UI on the card itself. (Only the All tab inside an open sheet shows the "No one's reacted with this yet." copy when total is 0, but practically that path is unreachable since the strip hides itself.)
- [ ] **Delete own photo** — uploader deletes, photo disappears from both feeds
- [ ] **Upload error — friendly message + diagnostic panel** — if the upload fails, the Share Photo screen shows a user-facing message that includes the failed stage (e.g., "Upload failed at 'Getting upload URL...'", "Network timed out at 'Confirming...'") with a **Show details** link. Tapping it expands a `SelectableText` panel with stage / Dio type / HTTP status / response body for copy-paste diagnosis. NOT a raw stack-trace dump. The retry button re-runs the full flow from a fresh SAS.
- [ ] **Upload 429 cooldown UX (regression — should not normally fire post-2026-04-27)** — if APIM ever returns 429, the error message reads "Too many requests. Please wait Ns and retry." with seconds parsed from `Retry-After`. Both the inline "Tap to Retry" link AND the big "Upload to Event" button become disabled with a live `Wait Ns` countdown that ticks down each second. Re-enables automatically when the window expires. Per DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md / `apim_policy.xml` this should never fire from APIM; if it does, root-cause via BETA_OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK §2.
- [ ] **Delete own photo from feed 3-dot** — your own photo card shows a 3-dot icon in the header; tap → "Delete" (red) → dark "Delete Photo?" dialog → Confirm → card disappears immediately (no 30s flicker). SnackBar "Photo deleted".
- [ ] **Non-uploader sees no 3-dot on others' photos** — another user's photo card in the same feed has no 3-dot icon. Tapping into detail → PopupMenu shows Save + Share but no Delete.
- [ ] **Photo detail delete — feed invalidation** — delete a photo from the AppBar PopupMenu in detail view → pop back → feed is already missing the photo (no 30s wait).
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' photo from feed** — sign in as event organizer (a user who created the event but did NOT upload the target photo). Open the feed → 3-dot icon IS visible on the other user's photo card. Tap → menu reads "Remove" (not "Delete"). Tap → dark "Remove Photo?" dialog with body "You're removing this photo. It will be permanently deleted for everyone in this event." Confirm → card disappears immediately. SnackBar "Photo removed". On Device B (the original uploader), the photo disappears on the next 30s poll.
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' photo from detail** — open someone else's photo in detail view as the event organizer → AppBar PopupMenu shows "Remove" (red). Confirm → returns to feed with item already gone.
- [ ] **Uploader self-delete copy unchanged** — when the uploader deletes their own photo (even if they're also the organizer), dialog still reads "Delete Photo?" / "This photo will be permanently deleted." (uploader precedence over organizer).
- [ ] **Non-organizer non-uploader sees no 3-dot on photos** — a third clique member who is neither uploader nor event organizer opens the feed → no 3-dot on others' photo cards. Photo detail PopupMenu shows Save + Share but no Delete.

## 5. Videos

### Upload

- [ ] **Record video** — in-app camera records video (≤5 min)
- [ ] **Upload from camera roll** — pick existing video, validation passes
- [ ] **Reject >5 min video** — client shows duration error
- [ ] **Reject non-MP4/MOV** — client shows format error (if testable)
- [ ] **Upload progress** — progress screen shows percentage, blocks back button during upload
- [ ] **Local pending card** — after upload starts, event feed shows local pending video card immediately
- [ ] **Play from local file** — tap local pending card → video plays instantly from device (zero network wait)
- [ ] **"Playing from your device"** subtitle visible during local playback

### Processing

- [ ] **Processing state** — card shows "Processing for sharing..." while transcoding
- [ ] **Video ready transition** — card transitions from processing → poster + play icon (within ~15-60s depending on source)
- [ ] **No duplicate cards** — only one card for the video at all times (local → processing → active)
- [ ] **Push notification** — Device B receives "New video ready" push (Device A does NOT get FCM push for own video)
- [ ] **Web PubSub update** — Device A's card upgrades automatically without manual refresh

### Playback

- [ ] **HLS playback** — Device B taps video, player opens, video plays via HLS
- [ ] **MP4 fallback** — if HLS fails (check logs), MP4 fallback plays
- [ ] **Poster image** — feed card shows poster frame before tap
- [ ] **iPhone portrait → Android upright (rotation fix, added 2026-05-04)** — Device A (iPhone) records a PORTRAIT clip (hold phone vertically, capture 5-10 seconds — e.g. of a fixed object so orientation is unambiguous). Upload to a shared event. Device B (Samsung) opens the event feed and taps the poster. **Video plays UPRIGHT — subject vertical, ground on bottom, sky/ceiling on top.** Pre-fix this rendered rotated 90° CCW (per `video07.png` — dog visible sideways with floor on the right). Verify via App Insights `customEvents | where name == "video_transcoding_completed" | extend rot = toint(customDimensions.sourceRotation), mode = tostring(customDimensions.processingMode) | project rot, mode` — the new video shows `mode=transcode` (slow path was forced) and `rot ∈ {90, 270}` (typical iPhone portrait)
- [ ] **iPhone landscape → all viewers regression** — same flow but iPhone records LANDSCAPE. App Insights shows `mode=stream_copy`, `rot=0`. Plays correctly on both Android and iPhone viewers. Confirms the fast path still works for non-rotated sources
- [ ] **Android portrait → iPhone viewer upright** — Device A (Samsung) records portrait, uploads. Device B (iPhone) opens feed, taps, plays UPRIGHT. (Modern Android cameras with Display Matrix benefit from the fix incidentally)
- [ ] **iPhone HEVC HDR portrait** — Device A (iPhone, default High Efficiency setting) records a portrait clip (HDR is enabled by default in modern iOS Camera). Slow path was already taken pre-fix; verify the new metadata clear doesn't regress (no double-rotation = no upside-down playback)
- [ ] **iOS cloud playback (PRIMARY REGRESSION FIX, added 2026-05-03)** — Account A (Android) uploads a video, waits for `video_ready`. Account B (iPhone) opens the event feed, taps the poster card. **MP4 begins playback within ~3-5 seconds. NO infinite spinner. NO 15s wait.** Caption area does NOT show "Playing standard quality" (because `_iosForcedMp4` is the primary path on iOS, not a fallback). Verify via `[VPS] tier=cloud: iOS — skipping HLS, going to MP4` log line in Xcode device console
- [ ] **Android cloud playback unchanged** — same test, Android viewer. HLS still plays first, `_usedFallback` remains false on happy path. Verify via `[VPS] tier=cloud: got playback info, attempting HLS first` log line
- [ ] **iOS local-file playback unchanged** — uploader (iPhone) records or picks a video, taps the local-pending card immediately. Plays from device file with zero network wait. Caption: "Playing from your device". Verify via `[VPS] tier=local: file.exists()=true` then `tier=local: initialize() returned OK` log lines
- [ ] **iOS instant-preview playback unchanged** — uploader's local file unavailable (force `localFilePath: null`); tap during processing. Plays from preview SAS URL. Caption: "Playing preview while we finish processing...". Verify via `[VPS] tier=preview: initialize() returned OK` log line
- [ ] **iOS player init timeout safety net** — enable airplane mode, then tap a cloud video that has not been cached. Within 15s the friendly error "Playback didn't start in time. Tap back and try again." appears. Back button works. Disabling airplane mode + retry works. Verify via `[VPS] tier=mp4: initialize() FAILED ... TimeoutException` log line
- [ ] **iOS local-file timeout (8s)** — corrupt a local recording (truncate to <1KB) → friendly error within 8s, no hang
- [ ] **`mounted`-race regression** — tap a cloud video, immediately tap the back arrow before init completes. App does not crash; no orphaned `AVPlayerItem` warnings in Xcode console; navigation succeeds cleanly. Verify via `[VPS] _wireChewie: !mounted, disposing` log line

### Actions

- [ ] **Save video to device** — player menu → "Save to Device" → video in gallery
- [ ] **Multi-select video download** — enter selection mode → video cards show checkboxes → select videos → download
- [ ] **Processing video excluded from selection** — video still processing → no checkbox shown
- [ ] **Share video** — player menu → "Share" → OS share sheet opens
- [ ] **Delete video** — player menu → "Delete" → confirmation → video removed from feed
- [ ] **Delete during processing** — delete a video that's still processing, card disappears cleanly
- [ ] **React to video** — on a ready video card in the feed, tap each of ❤️ 😂 🔥 😮 below the poster; pill highlights immediately and count increments. Tap again to unlike — count decrements and pill de-highlights. Pull-to-refresh: counts match server state. Bar should NOT appear on processing / failed / local-pending video cards.
- [ ] **Video reactor strip + sheet** — same flow as photos. Strip hidden until first reaction. Tap → sheet with All + per-type tabs. Long-press a pill → sheet pre-filtered. Strip + bar are gated on `video.isReady`, so processing/failed/local-pending cards never show either.
- [ ] **Same-session add+remove on a fresh reaction** — like a photo OR video that you haven't reacted to before, then immediately unlike it without refreshing the feed. 30s later (after the feed polls), the reaction must stay removed — regression check for the pre-2026-04-17 bug where the DELETE silently no-op'd and the reaction re-appeared.

### Error handling

- [ ] **Video limit reached** — upload 10 videos, attempt 11th → error message shows correct limit ("10-video limit")
- [ ] **Network error** — start upload, disable WiFi mid-upload → error message, retry possible
- [ ] **Failed upload card** — if upload fails, card shows error state with Play + Retry buttons
- [ ] **Delete own video from feed 3-dot** — your own video card (any state: processing / failed / ready) shows a 3-dot icon in the header; tap → "Delete" → confirm → card disappears. SnackBar "Video deleted".
- [ ] **Non-uploader sees no 3-dot on others' videos** — another user's video card has no 3-dot icon. Player screen PopupMenu shows Save + Share but no Delete.
- [ ] **Delete own processing video — no ghost card** — tap Delete while the video is still transcoding → card disappears → does NOT re-appear as a "Polishing your video" ghost card after 30s (local-pending retire loop must have cleared it).
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' video from feed** — sign in as event organizer (not the uploader). Feed shows 3-dot on the other user's video card. Tap → menu reads "Remove". Confirm → "Remove Video?" dialog with body "You're removing this video. It will be permanently deleted for everyone in this event." Confirm → card disappears. SnackBar "Video removed".
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' video from player** — open someone else's video player as organizer → AppBar PopupMenu shows "Remove" (not "Delete"). Confirm → returns to feed with item gone.
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' processing video** — uploader's video is still transcoding, organizer taps 3-dot → "Remove" → card disappears, no ghost re-render. Backend telemetry: `video_deleted` with `deleterRole='organizer'`.
- [ ] **Uploader self-delete copy unchanged (video)** — uploader deletes their own video → dialog still reads "Delete Video?" / "This video will be permanently deleted."
- [ ] **Non-organizer non-uploader sees no 3-dot on videos** — third clique member who is neither uploader nor organizer sees no 3-dot on others' video cards.
- [ ] **Dialog consistency** — open each destructive dialog (event delete, leave clique, delete clique, remove member, delete account, delete photo, delete video). All 7 dialogs are pixel-identical (dark `#1A2035` bg, 16px corners, red `#EF4444` destructive button, 70% alpha body text).

## 6. Direct Messages

- [ ] **Start DM thread** — Device A taps member in event → DM screen opens
- [ ] **Send message** — type and send, message appears instantly
- [ ] **Real-time delivery** — Device B receives message in real-time (Web PubSub)
- [ ] **Push notification** — if Device B is backgrounded, receives "Message from..." push
- [ ] **Tap notification** — tapping DM push opens the correct thread
- [ ] ~~**Rate limiting** — send >10 messages in 1 minute → 429 error shown~~ — **N/A as of 2026-04-27**: APIM rate-limit-by-key was removed (see DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md). DM endpoints no longer return 429 from the gateway. If abuse becomes a real concern post-beta, add per-user / per-thread caps at the Functions layer
- [ ] **Read-only after expiry** — after event expires, DM thread is read-only

## 7. Notifications

- [ ] **In-app list** — notification bell shows list of all received notifications
- [ ] **Unread badge** — unread notifications show visual indicator
- [ ] **Mark as read** — tapping notification marks it read
- [ ] **Swipe to dismiss** — swipe right deletes individual notification
- [ ] **Clear all** — "Clear All" button with confirmation deletes all
- [ ] **Tap navigation** — tapping a notification navigates to the correct event/clique

### 7.1 New Event Real-Time Fan-Out (added 2026-04-30)

Cross-user real-time delivery — User B creates an event, User A (clique member, NOT the creator) sees it appear without restarting the app.

- [ ] **Foreground real-time (Android)**: User A on Home screen of clique-mate's clique. User B creates a new event in that clique. User A sees the new event card appear on Home within ~1 second. App Insights shows `new_event_push_sent` (server) and `new_event_received` (User A's device) correlated by `eventId`
- [ ] **Foreground real-time (iOS)**: same scenario on iPhone for User A
- [ ] **Backgrounded → tap FCM**: User A backgrounds the app. User B creates event. User A's device shows a heads-up FCM notification *"New Event!"* / *"{B} started '{eventName}' in {cliqueName}"* within ~3 sec. Tap → app opens to `/events/{eventId}` (Event Detail). `new_event_tapped_fcm` telemetry fires
- [ ] **Backgrounded → foreground via app icon**: User A backgrounds. User B creates event. User A foregrounds via app icon (NOT the notification). On resume, Web PubSub reconnects (`realtime_reconnected_on_resume` telemetry) and HomeScreen shows the new event card
- [ ] **In-app notifications list**: User A taps Notifications tab → sees a "New Event" row with event_rounded icon and gradient (electric-aqua → deep-blue). Body says *"{B} started '{eventName}' in {cliqueName}"*. Tap → routes to `/events/{eventId}`
- [ ] **Creator excluded**: User B (the creator) does NOT receive the FCM push, does NOT see a new notification row in their own list, and stays on Event Detail (where they navigated post-create) without disruption
- [ ] **Multi-device**: User A signed in on phone + tablet → both update simultaneously. Tap on either → both navigate independently
- [ ] **Sign-out cleanup**: User A signs out → Web PubSub disconnects (`disconnect()` log line in debug build) → User B creates event → User A's old device receives nothing
- [ ] **Re-sign-in re-connects**: User A signs back in → Web PubSub reconnects (`realtime_connected { reason: 'auth_start' }`) → next event from User B arrives real-time
- [ ] **Latent video_ready bug fix verification**: User A on Home (NOT on EventFeedScreen) → User B uploads a video to a shared event and waits for transcode → User A's `notificationsListProvider` invalidates within ~1 sec of `video_ready` delivery (verify by tapping Notifications tab and seeing the new row without pull-to-refresh). Pre-fix this would have required A to be on EventFeedScreen
- [ ] **No regression to Friday reminder** — verify §7.2 still passes

### 7.2 Weekly Friday Reminder (added 2026-04-30)

Client-only, scheduled via `flutter_local_notifications.zonedSchedule`. No FCM, no backend involvement. See `docs/NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` "Weekly Friday Reminder."

- [ ] **Channel exists** — Settings → Apps → Clique Pix → Notifications shows "Reminders" channel alongside "Clique Pix"
- [ ] **Channel description** — tapping the "Reminders" channel shows description *"Weekly Friday-evening nudge to create an Event"*
- [ ] **Initial schedule on sign-in (Android)** — sign in fresh; App Insights shows `friday_reminder_scheduled` with `reason: 'cold_start'`, the device's IANA TZ, and a `next_fire_at` matching next Friday 17:00 in that TZ
- [ ] **Initial schedule on sign-in (iOS)** — same, on iPhone
- [ ] **Pending registration check (Android)** — `adb shell dumpsys notification | grep cliquepix_reminders` shows ID 9001 registered (or temporarily add a debug `pendingNotificationRequests()` print)
- [ ] **Friday 5 PM fire (Android — manual clock)** — disable auto-time, set device clock to Friday 16:59:50 local, wait. Notification displays with title *"Evening or weekend plans?"* + body *"Don't forget to create an Event and assign a Clique!"* within 15 minutes (`inexactAllowWhileIdle` window)
- [ ] **Tap routing** — tap the notification → app lands on `/events` (Home dashboard). App Insights shows `friday_reminder_tapped`
- [ ] **Mute via OS** — turn off the "Reminders" channel in OS Settings; manually fire again → notification suppressed; "Clique Pix" channel still delivers a regular FCM photo notification (proves channel separation)
- [ ] **Sign out cancels** — sign out, roll device clock to next Friday 17:00 → no notification fires. App Insights shows no new `friday_reminder_scheduled` for this device
- [ ] **Re-sign-in re-schedules** — sign back in → `friday_reminder_scheduled { reason: 'cold_start' }` (cache cleared on sign-out, treated as fresh)
- [ ] **TZ change recovery (Android)** — change device timezone (Settings → Date & Time → Time zone → e.g. America/Los_Angeles → America/New_York). Background app, resume. App Insights shows `friday_reminder_scheduled { reason: 'tz_changed', iana: 'America/New_York' }` and `next_fire_at` reflects the new TZ
- [ ] **No-op on resume when nothing changed** — bring app to background, resume immediately. App Insights shows `friday_reminder_skipped_tz_unchanged`, NOT a re-schedule
- [ ] **iOS UNUserNotificationCenter** — iOS Settings → Notifications → Clique Pix shows the app listed and notifications enabled. (iOS does not expose channels — "Reminders" is Android-only naming)
- [ ] **Multi-device** — sign in on phone + tablet, both at same TZ. Friday 5 PM fires on BOTH (accepted, documented behavior)
- [ ] **App reinstall** — uninstall app, reinstall, sign in → fresh `cold_start` schedule fires; previous schedule was wiped with the app
- [ ] **iOS time-jump caveat** — note that manual clock changes on iOS do NOT always cleanly re-evaluate `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` schedules. If iOS manual-fire test fails, do NOT assume implementation is broken — wait for an actual Friday or test on Android

## 8. Auto-Deletion / Expiration

- [ ] **24h warning** — event created with 24h duration → "Event Expiring Soon" push arrives ~24h before expiry
- [ ] **Photos deleted** — after event expires, photos no longer load (SAS URLs invalid)
- [ ] **Videos deleted** — after event expires, video playback fails gracefully
- [ ] **Event removed** — expired event disappears from event list
- [ ] **Device copies preserved** — photos/videos saved to device still accessible after cloud expiry

## 9. Edge Cases

- [ ] **App kill during upload** — kill app during video upload, reopen → upload can be retried
- [ ] **Offline mode** — open app with no connection → cached content visible, error states for network actions
- [ ] **Background → foreground** — background app for 5 minutes, bring to foreground → feed refreshes
- [ ] **Pull to refresh** — pull down on event feed → content refreshes
- [ ] **Empty states** — new user with no cliques/events → appropriate empty state messages shown
- [ ] **Account deletion** — Settings → Delete Account → confirm → user removed, can't sign in

## 10. Profile Pictures (Avatars)

- [ ] **First-sign-in welcome prompt — Yes path** (fresh test account): sign up + pass age gate → lands on Events → welcome modal "Make yourself known" appears. Tap "Add a Photo" → picker sheet → crop + filter + frame → Save. Verify: avatar appears on Profile hero; kill & reopen app → prompt does NOT reappear (`shouldPromptForAvatar` now false because blob path is set).
- [ ] **First-sign-in welcome prompt — Maybe Later** (fresh account): tap "Maybe Later" → modal closes, no upload. Kill & relaunch → prompt does NOT reappear. SQL: `SELECT avatar_prompt_snoozed_until FROM users WHERE email_or_phone='<test>'` returns ~7 days out.
- [ ] **First-sign-in welcome prompt — No Thanks** (fresh account): tap "No Thanks" → modal closes. Relaunch → prompt does NOT reappear. SQL: `avatar_prompt_dismissed = TRUE`.
- [ ] **Cross-device welcome honoring**: sign in on iPhone, tap "Maybe Later". Sign in on Android 5 minutes later → prompt does NOT appear.
- [ ] **Cross-platform welcome (web)**: same user signs in at clique-pix.com → welcome modal appears if not yet dismissed/snoozed.
- [ ] **Profile tap to upload**: Profile → tap 'GW' gradient ring → bottom sheet → Take Photo → crop square → pick Warm filter → pick violet→pink frame preset → Save. Verify: confetti fires (first time only), haptic feedback, avatar updates in place.
- [ ] **Avatar on own photo cards**: navigate to an event feed where the user has uploaded a photo → within ≤30s (poll cycle) headshot appears on the card (not 'GW').
- [ ] **Avatar on other members' devices**: Device B opens the same event → verify uploader's headshot appears on their cards.
- [ ] **Avatar in DMs**: Device B opens a DM thread with the uploader → headshot in thread header + message bubbles.
- [ ] **Remove avatar**: Profile → tap avatar → Remove → confirm → avatar reverts to initials on Profile immediately; on feed cards after next poll.
- [ ] **Confetti one-shot**: second upload of a new headshot does NOT fire confetti again.
- [ ] **HEIC from iOS library**: pick a HEIC photo as avatar → JPEG conversion happens (network tab shows `image/jpeg` on the blob PUT).
- [ ] **PNG drag-drop (web)**: drag-drop a screenshot (.png) onto the web AvatarEditor → uploads as PNG → renders correctly.
- [ ] **Account delete cleans avatar blobs**: Profile → Delete Account → confirm → subsequent `GET https://stcliquepixprod.blob.core.windows.net/photos/avatars/{userId}/original.jpg` returns 404.

## 11. Profile & Legal

- [ ] **Settings tile order** — first settings group reads top-to-bottom: `About Clique Pix → Terms of Service → Privacy Policy → Contact Us`
- [ ] **Privacy Policy** — tap "Privacy Policy" on profile screen → in-app browser opens `https://clique-pix.com/docs/privacy` (legacy `/privacy.html` 301-redirects to this)
- [ ] **Terms of Service** — tap "Terms of Service" on profile screen → in-app browser opens `https://clique-pix.com/docs/terms` (legacy `/terms.html` 301-redirects to this)
- [ ] **Privacy Policy content** — page loads, 14 sections visible, covers photos, videos, DMs, effective date April 13, 2026
- [ ] **About dialog** — tap "About Clique Pix" → dialog shows version and "Private photo and video sharing" legalese
- [ ] **Contact Us dialog** — tap "Contact Us" → dark-themed dialog shows `support@xtend-ai.com` (selectable)
- [ ] **Contact Us — Copy Email** — tap "Copy Email" → dialog closes, "Email copied!" snackbar appears; pasting into another app yields `support@xtend-ai.com`
- [ ] **Contact Us — Send Email** — tap "Send Email" → device mail app opens with To `support@xtend-ai.com` and Subject `Clique Pix Support` pre-populated (Android requires the `mailto` `<queries>` entry in `AndroidManifest.xml`)
- [ ] **Delete account** — confirmation dialog appears, account deletion succeeds, redirects to login

## 11. Performance Checks

- [ ] **Photo upload speed** — capture to visible in feed: < 5 seconds on WiFi
- [ ] **Video transcoding** — compatible source (H.264 SDR): ready within ~25 seconds total
- [ ] **Feed scroll** — 60fps, no jank with 20+ items
- [ ] **App cold start (returning user, cached)** — sign in, populate Home with at least 2 events + 1 clique, force-stop. Re-launch. **Events list must be visible within < 1 s of first frame.** A small "Refreshing…" pill should appear above the list while the background fetch runs; pill disappears when fresh data lands. NO full-screen blocking spinner. (`home_first_render_ms` p95 < 1 s in App Insights — `hadCache=true`.)
- [ ] **App cold start (returning user, airplane mode)** — repeat above with airplane mode toggled on after force-stop. Events still render from cache. The pill swaps to "Couldn't refresh — tap to retry" (red icon). Tapping triggers a refresh attempt (still fails), pill stays. Disable airplane mode → pull-to-refresh → pill returns to "Refreshing…" → list updates.
- [ ] **App first-ever launch (no cache)** — fresh install, sign up. After auth resolves, Home shows **3-card shimmer placeholder** (NOT a full-screen `CircularProgressIndicator`) until the first `GET /api/cliques` + `GET /api/events` complete. Once data lands, brand-new empty state copy appears.
- [ ] **Multi-account cache isolation** — sign in as user A, populate cache, sign out (verify cache cleared in logs), sign in as user B. B sees skeleton, then B's events. NEVER A's. (Tests `ListCacheService().clearAll()` in `auth_repository.dart` `signOut`.)
- [ ] **App cold start** — splash to usable: < 3 seconds
- [ ] **Thumbnail load** — feed thumbnails load within 500ms on 4G
- [ ] **`deleterRole` telemetry recorded** — after running the organizer-delete tests above, query App Insights:
  ```kusto
  customEvents
  | where timestamp > ago(1h)
  | where name in ("photo_deleted","video_deleted")
  | where tostring(customDimensions.deleterRole) == "organizer"
  | project timestamp, name,
            uploaderId = tostring(customDimensions.uploaderId),
            eventOrganizerId = tostring(customDimensions.eventOrganizerId),
            userId = tostring(customDimensions.userId)
  ```
  Should return one row per organizer-delete with `userId == eventOrganizerId` and a non-empty `uploaderId` distinct from `eventOrganizerId`.
- [ ] **Background polling pauses** — open event feed (30 s polling active) → background the app → wait 2 minutes → check App Insights `customEvents` for `event_id=<eventId>` listings during the 2 min. **Should be zero** (polling pauses on `AppLifecycleState.paused`). Foreground the app → one immediate refresh fires + polling resumes.
- [ ] **WorkManager fires at most once per 4 hours** — `customEvents | where name == "wm_refresh_success" | summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)` should show ≤ 1 per hour (designed cadence ~3 / day). If it exceeds, the 4 h `wm_last_run_at_ms` SharedPreferences floor in `background_token_service.dart:callbackDispatcher` is broken.

## 12. Web Client (`https://clique-pix.com`)

Run in a fresh browser window per test where possible; for cross-browser coverage hit the full flow in Chrome AND Safari at minimum. Incognito for first-time-user tests.

### 12.1 Landing page (unauthenticated)

- [ ] **First-visit render** — fresh incognito → `https://clique-pix.com` → lands on marketing page; no login redirect, no flash of a sign-in screen
- [ ] **Hero** — reads "Your moments. Your people. No strangers."; gradient spotlights drift gently behind the content; phone mockup renders on the right with a `DemoMediaCard`
- [ ] **Tappable reactions** — clicking ❤️ 😂 🔥 😮 in the phone mockup increments the counter; clicking again decrements
- [ ] **Nav CTA (unauthed)** — top-right reads "Sign in" → routes to `/login`
- [ ] **HowItWorks** — 3 steps in order: Start an Event / Create or invite your Clique / Share, react, save what matters
- [ ] **App Store + Google Play badges** — render with styled black background + icons; `href="#"` placeholder is expected until listings publish
- [ ] **Live QR code** — Download section renders a scannable QR of `https://clique-pix.com`; scan with phone camera → opens the site
- [ ] **Footer links** — Privacy routes to `/docs/privacy`, Terms to `/docs/terms`

### 12.2 Landing page (authenticated)

- [ ] **Nav CTA (authed)** — sign in, then navigate back to `/` in same tab; top-right now reads "My Events →" (no auto-redirect)
- [ ] **Hero primary CTA** — authed, the "Get Started" button reads "Open my events" and routes to `/events`

### 12.3 Auth

- [ ] **Sign in** — Get Started → Entra hosted form → returns to `/auth/callback` → lands on `/events` without any visible error state
- [ ] **Age gate** — if a new test account under 13 signs up, the backend returns 403 AGE_VERIFICATION_FAILED → toast "You must be at least 13…" → logoutRedirect back to `/`
- [ ] **Network tab** — every request to `api.clique-pix.com` carries `Authorization: Bearer …`; no 401s in a normal session
- [ ] **Sign-out** — profile → sign out → MSAL clears → lands on `/` with "Sign in" visible again

### 12.4 Cliques

- [ ] **Create** — Cliques tab → New Clique → submit → URL becomes `/cliques/<id>?invite=1` and the **Invite dialog auto-opens** with a scannable QR + readable invite code
- [ ] **Print QR card** — Invite dialog → Print QR code → new route renders branded card with gradient header/footer, logo, "You're invited to join", Clique name, QR, and code. Print preview shows full-color gradient bands (no need to toggle "Background graphics")
- [ ] **Accept invite on web** — copy invite link → paste in incognito / second account → sign in → lands on `/invite/<code>` → "Joined" toast → routed to the Clique as a new member
- [ ] **Accept invite on mobile** — tap the same link on a physical iPhone/Android → Flutter app opens via Universal Links / App Links

### 12.5 Events + media

- [ ] **Create event** — works end-to-end, including picking or creating a Clique inline
- [ ] **Upload photo** — drag-drop a JPEG or HEIC → compressed + uploaded → appears in feed card within seconds
- [ ] **HEIC on Chrome** — HEIC from iPhone library pre-converts via heic2any and uploads successfully
- [ ] **Upload video** — pick a short (10-30 s) MP4/MOV → progress bar shows filename + percent + MB counter → card appears "Processing" → within ~30 s (fast path) transitions to active via Web PubSub `video_ready`
- [ ] **Video validation** — try a file > 500 MB OR > 5 min → rejected client-side before any network call
- [ ] **Media card** — each card shows uploader avatar (initials + gradient) + name + relative time + photo + reaction pills + download icon
- [ ] **Reactions** — tap ❤️ on a photo → counter increments optimistically → persists after page refresh
- [ ] **Web reactor strip + dialog** — once a card has at least one reaction, a "[avatars] N reactions" strip appears above the pills inside the card footer. Click → Radix dialog opens with `All N` tab pre-selected and tabs for each non-empty reaction type. Each row shows uploader avatar + name + the emoji. Click ❤️ tab → list filters. Close X works. App Insights `web_reactor_list_viewed` event present. Test on photos AND videos
- [ ] **Web — strip hidden at 0 reactions** — a fresh photo with no reactions does NOT render the strip
- [ ] **Web — strip text matches pill totals** — verify `N reactions` text equals the sum of pill counts when one user has reacted with multiple types
- [ ] **Delete own media** — 3-dot menu visible only on your own cards → Delete → confirm dialog → card disappears
- [ ] **Organizer can remove others' media on web** — sign in (browser 2) as the event organizer who is NOT the uploader → 3-dot is visible on the uploader's photo + video cards → label reads "Remove" → confirm dialog title is "Remove this photo?" / "Remove this video?" with body about permanent deletion for everyone → confirm → toast "Photo removed" / "Video removed" → card vanishes. Test in BOTH Chrome AND Safari (HLS path differs)
- [ ] **Non-organizer non-uploader on web** — sign in as a third clique member who is neither uploader nor organizer → no 3-dot icon visible on others' cards in the feed
- [ ] **Photo download** — download icon saves `cliquepix-<id>.jpg` to Downloads folder
- [ ] **Video download** — download icon on a video card saves the MP4 fallback as `cliquepix-<id>.mp4`
- [ ] **Video playback (lightbox)** — tap a video card → lightbox opens; video auto-initializes and plays. Test on Safari (native HLS) AND Chrome (`hls.js` loads as a separate chunk)
- [ ] **SAS-expiry recovery** — leave the player paused > 15 minutes, then seek → player should re-fetch `/playback` and resume. Look for `web_playback_sas_recovered` in App Insights

### 12.6 DMs + notifications

- [ ] **DM thread real-time** — two accounts in the same Clique/event → account A sends a message → account B sees it within ~1 s (no refresh)
- [ ] **Rate limit** — send >10 messages in a minute → toast "Slow down — max 10 messages per minute"
- [ ] **Notifications bell** — a new photo upload by someone else triggers the notification bell badge (polling every 60s + Web PubSub real-time while the tab is open)
- [ ] **Expired event** — messages in an expired event's thread are read-only (composer hidden, banner shown)

### 12.7 Cross-browser matrix

- [ ] Chrome latest (desktop) — full pass
- [ ] Safari latest (desktop) — native HLS playback path, Web Share fallback
- [ ] Firefox latest (desktop) — `hls.js` playback path
- [ ] Edge latest (desktop) — should match Chrome
- [ ] iOS Safari — sign in, video playback, file picker (HEIC native)
- [ ] Android Chrome — video playback, file picker, drag-drop

### 12.8 Accessibility + performance

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation** — tab through landing page hero → CTA → badges → sections; no keyboard traps
- [ ] **`prefers-reduced-motion`** — enable in OS accessibility settings → gradient-drift animations stop on the landing hero; scroll-reveal falls through to immediate visibility
- [ ] **Lighthouse** — desktop, incognito landing page → Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90
- [ ] **Bundle budget** — initial JS ≤ 400 KB total / 130 KB gzip; `hls.js` loads as a separate on-demand chunk

## Known Limitations (Beta)

- No notification batching — multiple rapid reactions = multiple pushes
- No offline queue — actions require network connectivity
- Video upload requires app to stay open (no background upload)
- SAS token expiry (15 min) may interrupt paused video playback
- Web PubSub token refresh not auto-negotiated before expiry
