# Microsoft Entra External ID Refresh Token Workaround — Clique Pix

**Last updated:** 2026-04-19
**Status:** 5-layer defense + optimistic auth bootstrap.
**Issue type:** Known Microsoft bug — no portal-based fix.

---

## Optimistic authentication — the user-facing contract

Clique Pix does not block its UI on a network round-trip at launch. Before `runApp`, `main.dart` reads the access token and a cached `UserModel` from `FlutterSecureStorage`. If both are present, `AuthNotifier` is seeded with `AuthAuthenticated(cachedUser)` so the router resolves straight to `/events` on the first frame — no splash, no spinner, no LoginScreen touch. If storage is empty, `AuthNotifier` is seeded with `AuthUnauthenticated`, so LoginScreen renders with an enabled "Get Started" button on the first frame.

Background verification fires after mount: `AuthNotifier._verifyInBackground` wraps `silentSignIn` with an 8-second `Future.timeout`. On success it replaces the provisional cached user with the authoritative server record. On session-expired signatures (`AADSTS700082`, `AADSTS500210`, `no_account_found`, or the synthetic `silent_signin_timeout`) it emits `AuthReloginRequired` — the GoRouter redirect bounces the user from `/events` back to `/login`, and LoginScreen pops the `WelcomeBackDialog` for one-tap re-auth.

Non-session transient failures (network hiccup during verification, backend 5xx) keep the optimistic `AuthAuthenticated` in place. The app continues; the next app resume (Layer 3) or 401 (AuthInterceptor) retries the refresh.

User-visible outcomes:

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Returning user with valid session | Instant — first frame is Events |
| First-time user / signed out | Instant — LoginScreen with enabled Get Started |
| Returning user whose session expired (12h+) | ~2s Events flash → WelcomeBackDialog |
| MSAL wedged or corrupt cache | ~8s Events → WelcomeBackDialog (bounded by Future.timeout) |
| Backend unreachable at launch | Events shell renders; events list shows its normal error state; user retries |
| User taps Get Started and MSAL hangs | Button spinner + "Having trouble? Sign in with a different account" link appears at 15s |

Hard caps layered across the auth stack so nothing can hang indefinitely:

| Call site | Timeout |
|-----------|---------|
| `AuthNotifier._verifyInBackground` → `silentSignIn` | 8s |
| `AuthRepository.signIn` → `verifyAndGetUser` (post-browser) | 10s |
| `AuthRepository.signIn` → `backgroundTokenService.register` | 5s (catchError) |
| `AppLifecycleService._onAppResumed` → `_refreshCallback` | 8s |
| `AuthInterceptor.onError` (401) → `tokenStorage.refreshToken` | 8s |
| `AuthRepository.signIn` → `pca.acquireToken` (browser) | *untimed* — user types password |

One flag-ordering bug fixed in the same branch: `AppLifecycleService` now clears `pendingRefreshFlagKey` **before** awaiting the refresh. Previously a hung refresh left the flag set forever, and every subsequent app resume re-triggered the same hang — the "force-quit doesn't fix it" feedback loop users reported.

## Problem summary

Clique Pix uses Microsoft Entra External ID (CIAM) with Google / Apple / email-OTP sign-in. Entra External ID tenants enforce a **hardcoded 12-hour inactivity timeout** on refresh tokens. Standard Entra ID tenants get 90 days; External ID does not, and the setting is not exposed anywhere.

Symptom: after ~12 hours without opening the app, the next silent refresh fails with:

```
AADSTS700082: The refresh token has expired due to inactivity.
The token was issued on 2026-04-18T21:19:36Z and was inactive for 12:00:00.
```

Microsoft Q&A (April 2026) confirms the timeout cannot be raised. Their documented workaround — in the Azure Communication Services chat tutorial, "Implement registration renewal → Solution 2: Remote Notification" — is **silent push + background refresh**. That is what we implement.

Two additional moving parts the design accounts for:

- **MSAL iOS #2871** — federated users (Google / Apple — i.e., all Clique Pix users) hit `AADSTS500210` on `acquireTokenSilent` because MSAL targets the wrong authority URL. We detect this error code and route to Layer 5 rather than attempt an MSAL patch.
- **iOS silent push is opportunistic.** Apple throttles background pushes and will not wake a user-force-killed app or an app with Background App Refresh disabled. For those users, Layer 5 Welcome Back is the only recourse — documented, not hidden.

## History — what was here before, and why it didn't work

The codebase previously contained all five service classes (`AlarmRefreshService`, `AppLifecycleService`, `BatteryOptimizationService`, `BackgroundTokenService`, `WelcomeBackDialog`) — but:

- `AuthRepository` declared `alarmRefreshService` and `backgroundTokenService` as **optional** constructor parameters, and `authRepositoryProvider` never supplied them. Every `?.` callsite was a silent no-op.
- `AppLifecycleService.start()` was never called — the observer never registered.
- `BatteryOptimizationService` was never instantiated.
- `WelcomeBackDialog.show()` had no caller anywhere in the codebase.
- `BackgroundTokenService.callbackDispatcher` had a `TODO` where the MSAL call should be. The WorkManager callback always returned `true`, reporting "success" without doing anything.
- `main.dart` filtered the `TOKEN_REFRESH_TRIGGER` notification payload but nothing triggered a refresh in response.

On top of that, the original Layer 2 design was architecturally flawed: `flutter_local_notifications.zonedSchedule` with `exactAllowWhileIdle` **only schedules a notification to display** at a time — it does not execute code. `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` fires only on user tap. A silent `Importance.min` notification the user never saw was never tapped, so no code ever ran. The primitive was the wrong tool.

The current architecture deletes the notification-based Layer 2 entirely and replaces it with a server-triggered silent push.

## The 5 layers (as-shipped)

| Layer | Mechanism | Trigger | Platforms | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Battery-optimization exemption | First home-screen frame after login (Android only) | Android | Allows Layer 4 (WorkManager) + OS processes that deliver FCM to run reliably on Samsung/Xiaomi/Huawei |
| 2 | **Server-triggered silent FCM push** | Backend timer every 15 min, targeting users inactive 9–11h | both | Wakes the app in the background; app runs `acquireTokenSilent` in an isolate. If in-isolate MSAL fails (iOS plugin-channel limits), a fallback flag triggers a Layer-3 refresh on next resume |
| 3 | Foreground refresh on app resume | Every `AppLifecycleState.resumed` if token age ≥ 6h or pending flag set | both | Primary, most-reliable defense. Catches anyone who opens the app |
| 4 | WorkManager periodic task | Every ~8h with network constraint, plus a 4h SharedPreferences `wm_last_run_at_ms` floor | Android | Best-effort backup. Less reliable than Layer 2 (silent push) and Layer 3 (foreground) but adds another wake opportunity |
| 5 | Graceful re-login via Welcome Back | When silent refresh fails with AADSTS700082 / AADSTS500210 / no cached account | both | One-tap re-auth with `loginHint` pre-fill. Shown by `LoginScreen` when `AuthState` is `AuthReloginRequired` |

Key timing:
- Microsoft inactivity timeout: **12 hours** (hardcoded)
- Token "stale" threshold (Layer 3): **6 hours** — `AppConstants.tokenStaleThresholdHours`
- WorkManager interval (Layer 4): **8 hours** nominal — `AppConstants.workManagerIntervalHours`. Backed by a 4-hour `wm_last_run_at_ms` SharedPreferences floor inside `callbackDispatcher` so WorkManager catch-up executions cannot fire a successful refresh more than once per 4 h. Telemetry on 2026-04-27 showed `wm_refresh_success` firing 6× per minute with the previous `existingWorkPolicy: replace` setting; switching to `keep` + the 4 h floor restored the designed cadence (~3× per day)
- Silent push window (Layer 2): user inactive between **9 and 11 hours** (2h window before the 12h cliff)
- Silent push dedup: max 1 push per user per **6 hours** (`users.last_refresh_push_sent_at`)

### Backend

```

  shared/db/migrations/
    009_user_activity_tracking.sql       (new) — last_activity_at + last_refresh_push_sent_at
  shared/middleware/
    authMiddleware.ts                    — fire-and-forget last_activity_at update + verifyJwtAllowExpired

    timers.ts                            — refreshTokenPushTimer (CRON 7,22,37,52 */h)
    telemetry.ts                         (new) — POST /api/telemetry/auth
```

### Request flow (Layer 2 — the new part)

1. Any authenticated API call hits `authMiddleware.authenticateRequest`; that handler validates the JWT and fires a `UPDATE users SET last_activity_at = NOW() WHERE id = $1 AND (last_activity_at IS NULL OR last_activity_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 minute')` — capped at one write per minute per user, fire-and-forget (no await).
2. `refreshTokenPushTimer` runs at :07, :22, :37, :52 every hour. It selects `(user_id, token, platform)` tuples where `last_activity_at BETWEEN NOW() - INTERVAL '11 hours' AND NOW() - INTERVAL '9 hours'` and the user hasn't been pushed in 6h. Per user, it sends a silent FCM push with `data: { type: 'token_refresh', userId }`, no `notification` block.
3. `sendSilentToMultipleTokens` builds the FCM v1 body via `buildFcmMessageBody({silent: true})`, which sets `apns-push-type: background`, `apns-priority: 5`, `apns-topic: com.cliquepix.app`, `apns.payload.aps.content-available: 1`, and `android.priority: high`.
4. iOS wakes the app via APNs background push; Android wakes via high-priority data message. Both land in `_firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler` (top-level, `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`).
5. The handler branches on `message.data['type'] == 'token_refresh'`. It constructs a fresh `SingleAccountPca` from `MsalConstants`, calls `acquireTokenSilent`, writes the new access token via `TokenStorageService.saveTokens` (which updates `lastRefreshTime`), and records `silent_push_refresh_success` in the pending-telemetry ring buffer.
6. If step 5 throws (iOS plugin-channel limits in a background isolate are a known risk), the handler writes `SharedPreferences[pendingRefreshFlagKey] = true` and records `silent_push_fallback_flag_set`.
7. `AppLifecycleService._onAppResumed` reads both `isTokenStale()` and the pending flag; if either is set, it runs Layer 3 immediately, clears the flag, and reports success/failure.

### Cold-start recovery (Layer 5 entry)

If the app is cold-started after > 12h, `AuthNotifier.checkAuthStatus` → `silentSignIn` → MSAL throws (`AADSTS700082` / `AADSTS500210` / "no account in the cache"). `_handleSilentSignInFailure` inspects the message and, if `lastKnownUser.email` is non-null, emits `AuthReloginRequired(email, name)`. `LoginScreen` watches `authStateProvider` and shows `WelcomeBackDialog.show()` with `loginHint = email` — one tap re-signs in.

---

## Known unknowns / honest limitations

1. **iOS `msal_auth` in a background FCM isolate.** The Keychain cache is process-wide so the account is visible. But `msal_auth`'s iOS plugin channel registration may or may not succeed in a background isolate. If `acquireTokenSilent` throws, the fallback flag keeps us correct — refresh happens on next foreground inside the 12h window because the silent push arrived at 9–11h. Worst case we fall to Layer 5 for users who got the silent push but didn't open the app for the next hour.
2. **APNs throttling.** Apple delivers background pushes "opportunistically." The `refresh_push_timer_ran.sent` vs `silent_push_received` ratio in App Insights will quantify real-world deliverability.
3. **Force-killed iOS apps do not receive silent pushes.** iOS policy. Layer 5 is the only recourse.
4. **Android SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM (API 31+).** We no longer use `exactAllowWhileIdle` scheduled notifications, so this permission is not on the critical path for Layer 2 anymore. The manifest still declares it for future use; revisit if anything else needs exact alarms.
5. **Disabled Background App Refresh (iOS).** Background handler never runs; Layer 5 handles the re-login.

## Verifying in production

App Insights Kusto:

```kql
// Layer health, all 5 layers, last 24h
customEvents
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| where name in ("battery_exempt_granted",
                 "silent_push_received", "silent_push_refresh_success",
                 "silent_push_refresh_failed", "silent_push_fallback_flag_set",
                 "foreground_refresh_success", "foreground_refresh_failed",
                 "wm_refresh_success", "wm_refresh_failed",
                 "welcome_back_shown", "cold_start_relogin_required")
| summarize count() by name, bin(timestamp, 1h)
| render timechart
```

Target: `foreground_refresh_success` + `silent_push_refresh_success` + `wm_refresh_success` ≫ `welcome_back_shown`. If `welcome_back_shown` is dominant, a background layer is broken.

Silent push deliverability:

```kql
customEvents
| where timestamp > ago(7d)
| where name in ("refresh_push_timer_ran", "silent_push_received")
| extend value = iff(name == "refresh_push_timer_ran",
                     toint(customDimensions.sent), 1)
| summarize sent = sumif(value, name == "refresh_push_timer_ran"),
            received = countif(name == "silent_push_received")
| extend delivery_pct = 100.0 * received / sent
```

Per-device diagnostics: tap the version text 7 times on the Profile screen to unlock the Token Diagnostics screen. It shows current token age, pending-refresh flag, battery-exempt status, and the last 50 telemetry events (drained from the cross-isolate ring buffer).
